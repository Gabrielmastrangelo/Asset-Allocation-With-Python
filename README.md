# Passive Investing

This repository was initialy created to share my project for my course of Business Computing.
I wrote an article talking briefly about passive investing and asset allocation, 
In the end, I made a historical simulation using Python. Now, I am developing this repository to show some
python applications for asset allocation and finance.

The article content:
- The most important topics that affect returns,
- The efficient market hypothesis,
- Passive investing methodology for individual investors,
