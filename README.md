# Passive Investing

This repository was initially created to share my project for my course in Business Computing.
I wrote an article talking briefly about passive investing and **asset allocation**, 
In the end, I made a historical simulation using **Python**. Now, I am developing this repository to show some
python applications for **asset allocation** and **finance**.

The article content:
- The most important topics that affect returns,
- The efficient market hypothesis,
- Passive investing methodology for individual investors,

### 1 - Hello World Portfolio
Here, just to initiate the topic of asset allocation and python for financial applications, we developed a portfolio with no rebalance and no changes.
It is noticeable, that as the equity share of the portfolio outperforms the others classes, it becomes more volatile and less diversified. 
But we will analyze it deeper when we use python for computing portfolio metrics. [Code](1-BasicPortfolio/1-basicPortfolio.ipynb)

### 2 - Fixed Frequency and Weights Rebalancing 
It was introduced a portfolio with the same assets classes and weights as the last one, but this time we had rebalanced the portfolio for fixed weights in a fixed interval of time. It performed worst than the last portfolio in absolute terms (compounded return), but it was more diversified and probably much less volatile. Again, we will compare it better when we introduce the metrics computation for assets.

### 3 - Computing Portfolio Metrics
Python applications for calculating annualized return and volatility. This was just the beginning, there is a lot to show when talking about portfolio metrics. And python is a really useful tool for that. [Code](https://github.com/Gabrielmastrangelo/Quantitative-Finance-with-Python/blob/main/3-PortfolioMetrics/3%20-%20portfolioMetrics.ipynb)
